## Terraform provides a number of commands that you can use to manage your infrastructure. Here are some of the most common Terraform commands and what they do:

- `init`: Initializes a new or existing Terraform working directory. This command downloads and installs the required plugins and modules needed for Terraform to work with the specified configuration.

- `plan`: Generates an execution plan that shows what Terraform will do when it applies your configuration. This command compares your desired infrastructure state to your current infrastructure state and shows you the changes that Terraform will make.

- `apply`: Applies your configuration to the infrastructure, creating, modifying, or deleting resources as necessary to bring your infrastructure into the desired state.

- `destroy`: Destroys all the resources that were created by your Terraform configuration.

- `import`: Imports an existing resource into your Terraform state. This command is used when you have resources that were created outside of Terraform, and you want to manage them with Terraform.

- `state`: Provides information about the current Terraform state, including the resources that are currently managed by Terraform and their status.

- `output`: Displays the values of outputs defined in your Terraform configuration.

- `refresh`: Updates the state file to match the current state of the resources in your infrastructure.

- `validate`: Validates your Terraform configuration files to ensure that they are syntactically correct.

- `fmt`: Formats your Terraform configuration files to make them more readable and consistent.

- `taint`: Manually marks a resource as tainted, which means that Terraform will recreate the resource on the next apply command.

- `untaint`: Removes the "tainted" state from a resource.

- `version`: Displays the Terraform version that you are currently using.
