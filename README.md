# Terraform Learning Repository

This repository contains various Terraform code snippets and projects to help me learn and understand Terraform, a popular infrastructure as code tool. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (if you're using AWS as your infrastructure provider)

## Steps

1. Clone the repository.

2. Change into the repository directory:

3. Initialize Terraform:


4. Create a Terraform plan:

5. Apply the Terraform plan:

6. Destroy Terraform-managed resources:


## Projects

1. `example-01`: A simple Terraform project that creates an AWS EC2 instance.
2. `example-02`: A Terraform project that creates a VPC, subnets, and an EC2 instance in AWS.

## Conclusion

This repository is meant to be a hands-on learning experience for Terraform. As you go through each project, try to understand what each Terraform configuration file does and why it's necessary.
